			<h3>CSS Blending Modes</h3>
			<h4>March 3rd</h4>
		</header>
		</p>
		With the advent of CSS3, many new features are available to web developers that designers have been using in their work for years. One of the most crucial of these is the set of blending modes familiar to users of Photoshop or Illustrator. These blending modes are quite easy to implement with the the attribute: <code>background-blend-mode: mode;</code>

		<p>
		The modes available are nearly as varied as those in Adobe software, including: <code>normal</code>, <code>multiply</code>, <code>screen</code>, <code>overlay</code>, <code>darken</code>, <code>lighten</code>, <code>color-dodge</code>, <code>color-burn</code>, <code>hard-light</code>, <code>soft-light</code>, <code>difference</code>, <code>exclusion</code>, <code>hue</code>, <code>saturation</code>, <code>color</code>, and <code>luminosity</code>.

			<h3>Using SVG Images</h3>
			<h4>February 10th</h4>
		</header>
		</p>As mobile and large-format screens continue to gain popularity, it's important to ensure that images display properly and scale appropriately without sacrificing clarity or quality. SVG images are a great way to achieve this during the web design process. <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/svg-styling-with-css/">This guide</a> outlines the various ways to include an SVG image on a page.

			<h3>Responsive CSS Icons</h3>
			<h4>February 3rd</h4>
		</header>
		</p>This is an interesting technique demonstrated by <a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> user, <a href="http://codepen.io/jordanoaragao/">Jordano Aragão</a>, wherein he creates scaleable icons that display advanced hover effects using only minimal Javascript. The best part is that each icon only inhabits a single <code>div</code> element within the html code and the images are created entirely with CSS, as demonstrated in my post from January 13th.

			<h3>2013's Best Web Fonts</h3>
			<h4>January 29th</h4>
		</header>
		</p><a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast<a>, a service for content creators to make a website without code, compiled <a href="http://typecast.com/blog/best-new-web-fonts-of-2013?kme=Clicked+ToS3+E-mail&kmi=scott_fl%40me.com&km_variation=top+button">this helpful list<a> of web fonts that were either created or came to prominence in 2013. While Google's growing collection of web fonts can provide a suitable typeface in most cases, it is nice to be able to branch out to other sources when trying to achieve a certain look or simply create a unique page.

			<h3>Pure CSS Dropdown Menu</h3>
			<h4>January 15th</h4>
		</header>
		<p>In working on my portal page, I wanted to create an uncluttered navigation menu that would intuitively house the many items that will eventually need to be accessed through it. I came across <a href="http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu">this guide</a> to create such a navigation system without using Javascript. Though it provides a very clear and complete method for doing so, as an educational tool the guide falls short. The author fails to differentiate which CSS elements control the function of the navigation menu and which are merely part of the heavy styling they have applied. I managed to glean the key function elements as being:</p>
		<blockquote><code>nav ul ul{
	display: none;
	}</code>
	<br>and<br>
	<code>nav ul li:hover > ul{
	display: block;
	}</code></blockquote>
		<p>Though I have yet to incorporate this function into my own code, I'm sure the underlying principle has far greater application than simply creating menu systems.

			<h3>CSS Shapes</h3>
			<h4>January 13th</h4>

		<p>CSS-Tricks provides a very helpful cheat sheet for web designers which lists many different shapes created entirely in CSS (such as the one below) and the code required to create them. The code is directly editable on the website and is easy to copy and paste into your project.

			<h3>GitHub</h3>
			<h4>January 8th</h4>
		</header>
		<p>Though it's primarily targeted at software developers, 
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is an excellent resource for web designers as well. Those familiar with the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> source code management system may find the minimalist interface (at least on OSX) to be a more intuitive method to push assets to the server than more file-system oriented FTP clients. Its branching capabilities allow designers to work on multiple versions of the same project and then merge the best aspects of each together at the end of development, which can greatly benefit the learning process.
However, the most helpful aspect for aspiring designers is the large and very active community wherein thousands of developers have made their source code viewable to the public and participate in discussions about their projects and techniques. GitHub also gives its users a free space to host and demo their works in progress in order to receive feedback from the community at large.<br>
