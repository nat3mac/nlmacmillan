		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>Since PHP is a server-side process, it does not require any resources from the browser the way that client-side scripts like Javascript do. However, this means that PHP needs to be a part of the webpage it is included in. Luckily, the development team has made this a simple process. The <a href="http://us3.php.net/downloads.php">source code</a> has been packaged into various files compatible with all major server software including OSX, Windows, Linux, Apache, and even the ability to be installed directly within a webpage's file system for uses such as ours where we do not have root access to the server. Though perhaps we will not need to be inconvenienced even this small amount because it is becoming common practice among web hosts to include PHP on their servers from the beginning.
