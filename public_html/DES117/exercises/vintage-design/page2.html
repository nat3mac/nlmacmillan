			<li>Vintage design is inherently different from retro design in that what is considered vintage has been accepted as having high aesthetic value and adherence to principles of "good design". Though it may not reflect the styling of current design trends, it is timeless in its ability to convey form and content in a practical, elegant way. Conversely, retro design is generally not considered "good design" but has a high nostalgic or novelty value which justifies its continued usage.</li>
			<li>I would like to have better command over alignment and styling of CSS-based shape objects to better illustrate the art deco theme attempted herein.</li>
