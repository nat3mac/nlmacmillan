		<h4>Project Summary</h4>
			<p>The intention of this project is to create a home control system for a migrant farmworker home currently being developed for the Solar Decathlon. The system should be simple and intuitive to use, while presenting energy data in an attractive way to the users so that users can have access to the data if they desire it. If the user does not utilize this manual control, the system should take control, while keeping the user informed and aware of what it is doing.</p>
			<br>
		<h4 id="audience">Audience Profile</h4>
			<p>According to Villarejo (1992),
			<blockquote>Most workers are young (median age is 31 years), three out of four [75%] are men, two out of three [67%] are married, most (55%) have been in the U.S. for nine or fewer years...</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Many of the new indigenous migrants prefer [to] speak their own dialect and are not fluent or literate in Spanish.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>There has been a very substantial decrease in employer-provided housing… farm workers are generally unable to obtain housing in the normal market… our staff found individuals living in garages, in tool sheds, underneath porches, and in shanties of varied descriptions.</blockquote>
			Given this information, we must assume that our audience is unfamiliar with U.S. cultural norms and that we cannot rely on them being familiar with either English or Spanish. This dwelling will be a major shift from what many occupants are accustomed to, and we must strive to make the transition as unintimidating as possible.

		<h4>Reception/Positioning</h4>
			<p>Our interface aims to target the end user as much as possible. As a total home control option, it must be well received and accepted for the user to use it and for it to have any effect whatsoever. Because of the integrated systems nature of the product, a positive reception of our product is very necessary. The user cannot simple replace it with a different one. Thus, we must make our functionality and interface appeal to as broad of a user base as possible.</p>
			<br>
		<h4>Communication Strategy</h4>
			<p>We will attempt to rely on text-based interface options as little as possible given that many of our audience members are not proficient in English or Spanish. When text is required, it will be succinct and written in plain language in order to effectively communicate its purpose. A primary concern will be to communicate abstract, technical energy data as a more general term which is easier to understand, while still using a primarily iconographic approach. Simple and easy to use interface options could allow for user choice in interface styles, especially for applications that vary based on geography and culture.</p>
			<br>
		<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
			<p>In order to provide the best user experience, we will employ large, unambiguous iconography and a muted color palette to draw attention to functionality. We must take care to avoid symbols that have become commonly associated with screen interfaces as these will be unfamiliar to our users. In order to lessen the learning curve, we intend to integrate our interface with a physical component. Physical interfaces are intuitive and straightforward, as well as being something people are used to working with. Thus, they are easy to adapt to and learn. Physical interfaces are more robust in varying conditions. Ex: A wet finger will cause a touch screen to go haywire. What if a user wants to adjust his AC right after washing some dishes?</p>
