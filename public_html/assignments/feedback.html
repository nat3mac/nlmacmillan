		Kate commented that our visual style provided a "pleasing glow" against the dark background. She suggested that we include current actual temperature along with our thermostat setting, and that we rethink our coloring of the thermostat control as the use of red "looks really hot". She recommended that we put a usage time indicator in our light control panel and warned us of the possibility of children messing with this control and disturbing other residents - perhaps this will turn into an information-only screen as power consumption is now. She brought up a point which we had not considered which is the orientation of the dwelling in relation to the sun and how the angle of the sunlight affects the temperature and lighting of the home. John's only recommendation was that we solidify our target size for the interface.

		Justin had some intriguing feedback for us that challenged the conclusions we had previously drawn about our interface. He tasked us with coming up with different ways of representing temperature rather than simply a linear scale. He suggested using animated characters or other visual elements to portray the subjective perception of temperature rather than the quantitative approach we've been taking. In addition to this, he suggested keeping both Fahrenheit and Celsius units visible at all times in order to provide a learning experience for users of the interface. As far as general layout, he recommended placing our icons along the bottom of the screen, similar to the iOS tab bar interface, and lessening the visual significance of the icons if they are not going to display dynamic information.

		There were several key pieces of feedback we received during the visit from DES 191, foremost of which was the need for definition of hierarchy between visual elements. Users were confused from having all items on screen simultaneously and expressed their desire for separation of functions such that only one would occupy the screen at once. While the needs of our target audience dictate our lack of reliance on linguistic cues, users still wanted a form of direction, whether with labels or more robust iconography. Despite this confusion, users interacted rather well and discovered all interactive elements within seconds. However the majority were disheartened to discover that our functionality was lacking in some areas, especially in our usage feedback section. It seemed that users thought that their interaction with control elements would influence the data within the graph. Despite the fact that this section was entirely non-functioning for this build, general usage of the final product will not noticeably influence the graph either, so it is important to visually separate it from the control elements and perhaps add other interactivity.
