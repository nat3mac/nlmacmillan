		Given that this was my first hands-on encounter with jQuery, much of my final design was based on things I knew that I could reliably manipulate in CSS rather than learning the added functionality that a new language provides. Because of this, the images on the page replace each other rather than existing in a dynamic array. However, this is somewhat fortuitous in this instance as the added iconography works well as a visual statement in a sickeningly <i>flat design</i> environment. The arrangement of objects and their sequential appearance is due to the fact that I could not thing of a way to have all objects on screen and still maintain a narrative (or work on mobile in the least). As it stands, additional styling is needed to properly display on iPhone and smaller screen sizes, but works well on all three of the Android devices with which I tested.

		<h3>Evaluation of <i>Google Flights</i> Interface</h3>
		<h4>April 15th, 2014</h4>
		<p>Over the past week I have been trying to find a flight to New York for my cousin's graduation next month. As a broke college student it is important to me to be able to compare rates to find the cheapest flight, and as a designer it is important to be able to do this without excessive visual clutter or unnecessary options. <a href="http://google.com/flights">Google Flights</a> manages to accomplish both of these criteria in an easy-to-use, attractive package. The site is viewable and usable on both desktop and mobile screens, and is simple to use without prior knowledge (though my mother tells me differently from her experience in trying to book a flight).

		<h3>Response to <i>Web designers who can't code</i></h3>
		<h4>April 8th, 2014</h4>
		<p>I am fully in agreement with the sentiment of Elliot Jay Stocks’ article and believe that all people who use the web, not just designers, should have some basic understanding of the framework upon which it is built. Stocks makes a very valid point when saying that HTML and CSS are easy, certainly easier to grasp than any other languages, code or linguistic-based. I recall all too well a time about two years ago when I was one of those web designers who couldn’t code and it was a great hindrance to my work. At the time I was designing the user interface for a mobile application that was based on XHTML running inside of a native app frame, and while my initial mockups were well-received by some of the higher-ups at Intel, the programmers on my team told me that many elements of my design simply were not possible with the time and budget constraints placed upon us. It wasn’t until I actually began to learn the intricacies of the markup that I realized what was actually able to be accomplished and what parts of my concept were the overzealous aspirations of a novice designer. While the project was never finalised due to lack of grant renewal, the experience taught me that coding is not simply a means to an end, but an integral part of everything that we do in the virtual world. With more aspects of daily life being enveloped by ‘the cloud’ every day, it is not unreasonable to think that all web users, at least those for whom a part of their livelihood depends on market exposure, should have a rudimentary grasp of what comprises a web page and how to accomplish basic tasks within the markup. In a time of content management services and website builders, it is impractical for a small business to devote part of their budget to a dedicated web designer or IT professional, yet there is still plenty of slack to be taken up if these websites are to achieve their goals. Whomever is charged with maintaining these pages should be knowledgeable of the code they comprise instead of being reliant on the limited options granted by their training wheels of choice.</p>
